This Code is part of the intro course to React & Redux.

The course's goal would be to create from scratch these four applications, using "learning by doing" we will explore React & Redux basics while developing those examples.

Each example from the course can be found within this repo. You can either look at the files in a completed state, but on course's day we would delete the src folder and develop it from scratch.
